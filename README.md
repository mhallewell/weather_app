# weather_app

Started project by following guide found here: https://medium.com/@aakankshaws/using-beautifulsoup-requests-to-scrape-weather-data-9c6e9d317800
Next steps I want to track the weather for x days 
and then scrape the historical data from those predicted days and see if weather forecasts get more accurate as it gets closer to the predicted day
